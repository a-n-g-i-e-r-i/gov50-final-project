## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring (a) research question(s) related to the human experience of psychedelics, particularly the affective and phenomenological effects. In terms of data sources, I believe the most likely ones may be Erowid.org, https://www.psychedelicdata.io/about%3FhsLang=en.html, or Fireside Project. My main concern is getting permission to use the data, and ensuring that it passes muster with the IRB.
